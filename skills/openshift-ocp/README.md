## What It Does

Natural language OpenShift cluster management through Claude Code.
Just describe what you want — Claude calls the right tool automatically.

```
"Am I logged into OCP?"
"Show me all nodes"
"Are all cluster operators healthy?"
"Show pods in namespace openshift-monitoring"
"What OCP version is running?"
```

---

## Current Scope

This skill focuses on **OpenShift cluster management** — login, node health, pod status, and cluster operator monitoring. All tools below marked ✓ are fully tested against a live OCP 4.14 cluster.

> **Note:** The `nginx_deploy` skill is included in the codebase as a contribution template but has **not been fully tested**.
> Community contributions to extend, test, or improve it are very welcome — see the Contributing section below.

## Architecture

```
You (natural language)
        ↓
Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md + SKILL.md
        ↓
Claude calls MCP tool via .mcp.json
        ↓
FastMCP server (ocp_mcp_server.py) executes oc command
        ↓
Result returned and analyzed by Claude
```

**SKILL.md** → Tells Claude *when* to use which tool  
**FastMCP**  → Executes the actual `oc` commands  
**MCP**      → The protocol connecting Claude Code to the server

---

## Requirements

- Claude Code installed
- `oc` CLI installed and in PATH
- Python 3.8+ (tested on Python 3.12 / RHEL9)
- Active OCP cluster (tested on OCP 4.18 / Kubernetes v1.31)
- `pip install fastmcp`

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ibanerjeedoc21-source/ocp-claude-skills
cd ocp-claude-skills

# Install dependency
pip3 install fastmcp

# On RHEL9 with multiple Python versions:
python3.12 -m pip install fastmcp

# Verify
python3.12 -c "import fastmcp; print('fastmcp OK')"

# Verify oc is working
oc whoami

# Start Claude Code — MCP server starts automatically
claude
```

---

## Verify MCP Connected

Inside Claude Code:
```
/mcp
```

Expected output:
```
ocp-mcp · ✓ connected
  /ocp-mcp:pod_health_prompt
  /ocp-mcp:login_status_prompt
  /ocp-mcp:nginx_deploy_prompt
```

## MCP Primitives Used

This skill implements all three MCP primitives:

```
Tools     → oc command execution         (8 tools)
Prompts   → reusable analysis templates  (3 prompts)
Resources → live cluster context         (2 resources)
```

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] `oc describe pod` for deep pod inspection
- [ ] `oc get events` for cluster event analysis
- [ ] `oc logs` streaming via WebSocket transport
- [ ] OpenShift AI / RHOAI namespace monitoring
- [ ] HTTP+SSE transport for remote VM access
- [ ] Test and complete nginx_deploy skill

---

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome!

- To **test and complete** the nginx_deploy skill — see `.claude/skills/nginx_deploy/SKILL.md`
- To **add new OCP tools** — follow the existing pattern in `ocp_mcp_server.py` and add a corresponding SKILL.md
- Please keep tools compatible with both **Claude Code** and **Aider** (use `**Triggers:**` and `**Run:**` annotations in SKILL.md)
