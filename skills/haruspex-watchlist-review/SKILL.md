name: haruspex-watchlist-review
description: Batch review of a stock watchlist using Haruspex scores, optimized for daily or weekly portfolio scans. Use this skill whenever the user wants to review multiple tickers at once, asks for a "watchlist update" or "portfolio review", lists 3 or more ticker symbols and wants analysis on all of them, asks "how are my stocks doing", wants a daily or weekly market check on specific names, or asks to compare or rank a group of stocks — even if they don't say "watchlist" explicitly. Prefer this skill over running haruspex-stock-analyst once per ticker when 3+ tickers are involved.

# Haruspex Watchlist Review

## What this skill does

Runs a single batched call against the Haruspex API and produces a scannable
table review of a watchlist: ranked by score, grouped by signal, with the
biggest movers and the largest dimensional flags surfaced separately.

Optimized for the "morning coffee" use case — a fast read of the user's whole
watchlist that surfaces what changed and what to look at more closely.

## When to use this skill

Trigger on any of these patterns:

- "Watchlist update" / "Run my watchlist" / "Daily check"
- "How are my stocks doing?"
- The user lists **3 or more tickers** in a single message
- "Compare AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN"
- "Portfolio review" / "Weekly review"
- "Which of these is strongest?" with a list
- "Rank these tickers"

Defer to a sister skill if:
- Only **1–2 tickers** mentioned → use `haruspex-stock-analyst` instead.
- The user states a thesis on a position → use `haruspex-thesis-tracker`.
- The user is writing in Japanese → use `haruspex-stock-analyst-ja`.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires `@haruspex-guru/mcp-server` to be installed and connected.
**First action: verify the MCP tools are available.**

If `get_batch_scores` is not available, output the install instructions from
[`shared/MCP_SETUP.md`](https://github.com/Haruspex-guru/haruspex-skills/blob/main/shared/MCP_SETUP.md) and **stop**.

## Workflow

**Step 0 — Telemetry ping (do this first, always).** Before any other tool
call, invoke `record_skill_invocation` once with `skill: "haruspex-watchlist-review"`
and `client` set to the best-guess client surface (e.g. `claude-code`,
`claude-desktop`, `claude-ai`). This is anonymous aggregate telemetry — only
the skill name, version, and client tag travel. No tickers, no conversation,
no user identifiers. The call is fail-silent: if it errors or the tool is
unavailable, ignore it and continue. Do not retry, do not surface the result
to the user, and never block the review on this step.

1. **Collect the ticker list.** If the user provided tickers, parse them. If
   the user said "my watchlist" without specifying, ask for the list — never
   assume or invent one. Trim to ≤50 tickers (the batch limit).
2. **Single batched call.** Call `get_batch_scores(symbols=[...])`. Do not
   call `get_stock_score` per ticker — the batched call exists for this.
3. **Handle partial NOT_FOUND.** Some tickers in the list may not be in the
   Haruspex universe. They will be absent from `data.scores`. Compute the
   missing set and report it honestly. Do not fabricate scores for missing
   tickers.
4. **Sort and group.** Sort returned scores by `score` descending. Group by
   `signal` (buy / hold / sell). Within each group, list largest score
   first.
5. **Surface movers.** Identify the top 3 by absolute `|change|`. These get
   their own callout — the user wants to know what moved, regardless of
   direction.
6. **Surface flags.** Identify any ticker with a topic dimension worse than
   `score < 35` AND `change ≤ -5`. These are the "watch closely" flags.
7. **Output** in the format below.

## Output format

captured data.

## Watchlist Review — [N] tickers

### Buy signals
| Ticker | Score | Δ    | Outlook | Top driver        |

### Biggest movers
- **[SYM]** [+N] — [one-line context]
- **[SYM]** [-N] — [one-line context]
- **[SYM]** [+N] — [one-line context]

### Watch closely
- **[SYM]** — [dim] dropped to [N]/100 ([change]); [one-line context]

### Coverage gaps
- [SYM_A], [SYM_B] — not currently in the Haruspex universe.

### Section omission rules

- Drop empty signal-group sections (e.g. if no `sell` signals, omit that
  table entirely).
- Drop "Coverage gaps" if all tickers returned scores.
- Drop "Watch closely" if no dimension flags trigger.
- Always include "Biggest movers" — pick 1-3 by absolute change.
- Always include "Verify links" — one per ticker.

## Compliance rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

- **Do not give buy / sell / hold recommendations directed at the user.**
  The "Buy signals" / "Sell signals" headers are reporting the API's
  `signal` field as data — that's allowed. Do not say "you should buy
  these" or "sell these now."
- **Do not predict price movements.** Score change is observed; price is
  not predicted.
- **Do not provide position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit, or
  risk-management specifics** for any ticker on the list.
- **Do not infer holdings, allocation, or risk profile** from the list. The
  user gave you tickers, not a portfolio.
- **Acknowledge data limitations honestly.** Coverage gaps must be
  reported, not silently dropped.
- **Always include verify links** so the user can spot-check any row.
- **Always include the disclaimer footer** in the exact wording from
  [`https://github.com/Haruspex-guru/haruspex-skills/blob/main/shared/DISCLAIMER.md`](https://github.com/Haruspex-guru/haruspex-skills/blob/main/shared/DISCLAIMER.md).
- **Never fabricate** a score, ticker, change value, or share URL.
