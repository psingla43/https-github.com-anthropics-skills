# Calendar Scheduling & Booking

11 tools for calendar discovery, event querying, free slot finding, availability checking, RRULE expansion, atomic booking, and Open Scheduling. 9 read-only tools + 2 write tools (`book_slot`, `request_booking`).

## Runtime

These tools run inside the [Temporal Cortex MCP server](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp) (`@temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp`), a compiled Rust binary distributed as an npm package.

**Install and startup lifecycle:**
1. `npx` resolves `@temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp` from the npm registry (one-time, cached locally after first download)
2. The postinstall script downloads the platform-specific binary from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp/releases/tag/mcp-v0.7.5) and verifies its SHA256 checksum against the embedded `checksums.json` — **installation halts on mismatch**
3. The MCP server starts as a local process communicating over stdio (no listening ports)
4. Calendar tools make authenticated API calls to your configured providers (Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API, CalDAV endpoints)

**Credential storage:** OAuth tokens are stored locally at `~/.config/temporal-cortex/credentials.json` and read exclusively by the local MCP server process. No credential data is transmitted to Temporal Cortex servers. The binary's filesystem access is limited to `~/.config/temporal-cortex/` — verifiable by inspecting the [open-source Rust code](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp) or running under Docker where the mount is the only writable path.

**File access:** The binary reads and writes only `~/.config/temporal-cortex/` (credentials and config). No other filesystem writes.

**Network scope:** Calendar tools connect only to your configured providers (`googleapis.com`, `graph.microsoft.com`, or your CalDAV server). No callbacks to Temporal Cortex servers. Telemetry is off by default.

**Pre-run verification** (recommended before first use):
1. Inspect the npm package without executing: `npm pack @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp --dry-run`
2. Verify checksums independently against the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp/releases/download/mcp-v0.7.5/SHA256SUMS.txt) (see verification pipeline below)
3. For full containment, run in Docker instead of npx (see Docker containment below)

**Verification pipeline:** Checksums are published independently at each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp/releases/tag/mcp-v0.7.5) as `SHA256SUMS.txt` — verify the binary before first use:

```bash
# 1. Fetch checksums from GitHub (independent of the npm package)
curl -sL https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp/releases/download/mcp-v0.7.5/SHA256SUMS.txt

# 2. Compare against the npm-installed binary
shasum -a 256 "$(npm root -g)/@temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp/bin/cortex-mcp"
```

As defense-in-depth, the npm package also embeds `checksums.json` and the postinstall script compares SHA256 hashes during install — **installation halts on mismatch** (the binary is deleted, not executed). This automated check supplements, but does not replace, independent verification above.

**Build provenance:** Binaries are cross-compiled from auditable Rust source in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp/actions) across 5 platforms (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, win32-x64). Source: [github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp](https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp) (MIT-licensed). The CI workflow, build artifacts, and release checksums are all publicly inspectable.

**Docker containment** (no Node.js on host, credential isolation via volume mount):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "temporal-cortex": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "-v", "~/.config/temporal-cortex:/root/.config/temporal-cortex", "cortex-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Build: `docker build -t cortex-mcp https://github.com/temporal-cortex/mcp.git`

## Tools

### Layer 2 — Calendar Operations

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `list_calendars` | First call when calendars are unknown. Returns all connected calendars with provider-prefixed IDs, names, labels, primary status, and access roles. |
| `list_events` | List events in a time range. TOON format by default (~40% fewer tokens than JSON). Use provider-prefixed IDs for multi-calendar: `"google/primary"`, `"outlook/work"`. |
| `find_free_slots` | Find available gaps in a calendar. Set `min_duration_minutes` for minimum slot length. |
| `expand_rrule` | Expand recurrence rules (RFC 5545) into concrete instances. Handles DST, BYSETPOS, EXDATE, leap years. Use `dtstart` as local datetime (no timezone suffix). |
| `check_availability` | Check if a specific time slot is free. Checks both events and active booking locks. |

### Layer 3 — Cross-Calendar Availability

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `get_availability` | Merged free/busy view across multiple calendars. Pass `calendar_ids` array. Privacy: `"opaque"` (default, hides sources) or `"full"`. |

### Layer 4 — Booking

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `book_slot` | Book a time slot atomically. Lock → verify → write → release. **Always `check_availability` first.** |
| `request_booking` | Book on another user's public calendar by Temporal Link slug. Requires Platform Mode. |

### Layer 3 — Public Availability (Platform Mode)

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `query_public_availability` | Check another user's public availability by Temporal Link slug. Pass the slug and date to find their open time slots. |

### Layer 0 — Discovery (Platform Mode)

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `resolve_identity` | DNS for Human Time: resolve an email, phone, or agent ID to a Temporal Cortex slug. Call before `query_public_availability`. |

## Critical Rules

1. **Discover calendars first** — call `list_calendars` when you don't know which calendars are connected. Use the returned provider-prefixed IDs for all subsequent calls.
2. **Use provider-prefixed IDs** for multi-calendar setups: `"google/primary"`, `"outlook/work"`, `"caldav/personal"`. Bare IDs (e.g., `"primary"`) route to the default provider.
3. **TOON is the default format** — output uses TOON (~40% fewer tokens than JSON). Pass `format: "json"` only if you need structured parsing.
4. **Check before booking** — always call `check_availability` before `book_slot`. Never skip the conflict check.
5. **Content safety** — event summaries and descriptions pass through a sanitization firewall before reaching the calendar API.
6. **Timezone awareness** — all tools accept RFC 3339 with timezone offsets. Never use bare dates.

## Full Booking Workflow

```
1. Discover  →  list_calendars
2. Orient    →  get_temporal_context                      (temporal-cortex-datetime)
3. Resolve   →  resolve_datetime("next Tuesday at 2pm")  (temporal-cortex-datetime)
4. Check     →  check_availability(calendar_id, start, end)
5. Book      →  book_slot(calendar_id, start, end, summary)
```

If the slot is busy at step 4, use `find_free_slots` to suggest alternatives.

## Open Scheduling Workflow (Platform Mode)

```
1. Identify    →  resolve_identity("jane@example.com")  →  slug: "jane-doe"
2. Orient      →  get_temporal_context                   (temporal-cortex-datetime)
3. Discover    →  query_public_availability(slug, date)  →  available slots
4. Present     →  Show top 3 options to user
5. Book        →  request_booking(slug, start, end, title, attendee_email)
```

## Two-Phase Commit Protocol

```
Agent calls book_slot(calendar_id, start, end, summary)
    │
    ├─ 1. LOCK    →  Acquire exclusive lock on the time slot
    │                 (in-memory local; Redis Redlock in Platform Mode)
    │
    ├─ 2. VERIFY  →  Check for overlapping events and active locks
    │
    ├─ 3. WRITE   →  Create event in calendar provider (Google/Outlook/CalDAV)
    │                 Record event in shadow calendar
    │
    └─ 4. RELEASE →  Release the exclusive lock
```

If any step fails, the lock is released and the booking is aborted. No partial writes.

## Common Patterns

### List Events This Week

```
1. list_calendars → discover connected calendars
2. get_temporal_context → current time (use temporal-cortex-datetime)
3. resolve_datetime("start of this week") → week start
4. resolve_datetime("end of this week") → week end
5. list_events(calendar_id: "google/primary", start, end)
```

### Find Free Time Across Calendars

```
1. list_calendars → discover all connected calendars
2. get_availability(
     start, end,
     calendar_ids: ["google/primary", "outlook/work"],
     privacy: "full"
   ) → merged free/busy blocks with source_count
```

### Check and Book a Slot

```
1. check_availability(calendar_id: "google/primary", start, end) → true/false
2. If free: book_slot(calendar_id: "google/primary", start, end, summary: "Team standup")
3. If busy: find_free_slots(calendar_id, start, end, min_duration_minutes: 30)
```

### Expand Recurring Events

```
expand_rrule(
  rrule: "FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=-1",
  dtstart: "2026-01-01T10:00:00",     ← local datetime, no timezone suffix
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  count: 12
) → last Friday of every month for 2026
```

## Provider-Prefixed Calendar IDs

All calendar IDs use provider-prefixed format:

| Format | Example | Routes to |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `google/<id>` | `"google/primary"` | Google Calendar |
| `outlook/<id>` | `"outlook/work"` | Microsoft Outlook |
| `caldav/<id>` | `"caldav/personal"` | CalDAV (iCloud, Fastmail) |
| `<id>` (bare) | `"primary"` | Default provider |

## Privacy Modes

| Mode | `source_count` | Use case |
|------|---------------|----------|
| `"opaque"` (default) | Always `0` | Sharing availability externally |
| `"full"` | Actual count | Internal use — shows which calendars are busy |

## Tool Annotations (`book_slot`)

| Property | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `readOnlyHint` | `false` | Creates calendar events |
| `destructiveHint` | `false` | Never deletes or overwrites existing events |
| `idempotentHint` | `false` | Calling twice creates two events |
| `openWorldHint` | `true` | Makes external API calls |

## Tool Annotations (`request_booking`)

| Property | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `readOnlyHint` | `false` | Creates calendar events on another user's calendar |
| `destructiveHint` | `false` | Never deletes or overwrites existing events |
| `idempotentHint` | `false` | Calling twice creates two bookings |
| `openWorldHint` | `true` | Calls the Platform API |

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| "No credentials found" | Run: `npx @temporal-cortex/cortex-mcp auth google` (or `outlook` / `caldav`). |
| "Timezone not configured" | Prompt for IANA timezone. Or run the auth command which configures timezone. |
| Slot is busy / conflict detected | Use `find_free_slots` to suggest alternatives. Present options to user. |
| Lock acquisition failed | Another agent is booking the same slot. Wait briefly and retry, or suggest alternative times. |
| Content rejected by sanitization | Rephrase the event summary/description. The firewall blocks prompt injection attempts. |

## Open Scheduling & Temporal Links

When a user has Open Scheduling enabled, their Temporal Link (`book.temporal-cortex.com/{slug}`) allows anyone to:

1. **Query availability** — `GET /public/{slug}/availability?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
2. **Book a meeting** — `POST /public/{slug}/book` with `{start, end, title, attendee_email}`
3. **Discover via Agent Card** — `GET /public/{slug}/.well-known/agent-card.json`

### Workflow: Book via Temporal Link
1. User shares their Temporal Link
2. Agent calls availability endpoint to find free slots
3. Agent calls booking endpoint with selected slot
4. Meeting is created on the user's default calendar
